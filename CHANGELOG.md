Initial release.
Update for Docs.
Update for preventing multiple-load.
Oops! Configuration-file enabling was commented out. So 1.0.3 is the first working version!
... And then left comments in.
Fix for enabling by gemset.
Directories can now specify either the directory the gem directory is in or the gem directory itself.
